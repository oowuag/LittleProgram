/**
 * @brief Service Handler for Hands-Free Profile
 * @ingroup hfp
 *
 *
 * HfpService is a building block of Hands-Free Profile support,
 * implementing single-instance functions including inbound connection
 * handling and automatic reconnection.  As such, one instance of
 * HfpService is created per system.
 *
 * Each attachable Audio Gateway device (typically a cell phone) is
 * represented by a BtDevice object.  HfpService supports the creation
 * of an HfpSession object attached to the BtDevice, to support a Hands
 * Free Profile session with the device.  The life cycle of HfpSession
 * objects is described in the
 * @ref aglifecycle "Audio Gateway Life Cycle" section.
 *
 * @section hfpserviceoperation Service Operation
 *
 * Clients will typically instantiate one HfpService object, register
 * callbacks, e.g. HfpService::cb_HfpSessionFactory, read known devices
 * from a configuration file, and instantiate an HfpSession object for
 * each with GetSession().  The HfpSession objects can be marked
 * auto-reconnect, via RfcommSession::SetAutoReconnect(), so that they may
 * be automatically connected when they enter radio range.
 *
 * Whenever Hands-Free Profile service is active, HfpService maintains
 * a listening socket for inbound HFP service level connections.  Devices
 * not previously known to HfpService may initiate connections, and will
 * have HfpSession objects created for them.  The HfpService client may
 * control access by:
 * - Refusing to create HfpSession objects for unknown Bluetooth addresses,
 * using HfpService::cb_HfpSessionFactory
 * - Forcing disconnections when devices initiate connections and their
 * HfpSession objects enter the Connecting state, using
 * HfpSession::cb_NotifyDeviceConnection
 * - Requiring authentication, using SetSecMode().
 *
 * Authentication is managed at the system level and is beyond the scope
 * of HfpService or HfpSession other than imposing a requirement that
 * system authentication be upheld.  Additionally, Bluetooth HFP 1.5 does
 * not mandate any level of security on its RFCOMM connections.

 * object to cancel the command, although this may fail if the command

 *
 * The caller of the HfpSession method is entirely responsible for

/**
 * @brief Session object for Hands-Free Profile
 * @ingroup hfp
 *
 * This class represents a Hands Free Profile session and connection to
 * a remote audio gateway device (typically a cell phone).  An HFP session
 * through this object can allow the audio gateway to use a speakerphone
 * facility provided by the local system.  It supports numerous use cases:
 * - Interrogating the supported audio gateway features of the device
 * - Disseminating notifications from the device, e.g. signal strength
 * - Sending commands to the device, e.g. dial number, hangup
 * - Streaming audio to and from the device
 *
 * @section aglifecycle Life Cycle
 *
 * The associated HfpService object manages the life cycle of HfpSession
 * objects.  The HfpService keeps an index of HfpSession objects, and
 * ensures that at most one exists per attached BtDevice device object.
 * HfpSession objects may be instantiated through one of three paths:
 *
 * - Through HfpService::GetSession(), with @c create = @c true.  This
 * method requires a reference to an existing BtDevice object, or other
 * explicit knowledge of the Bluetooth address of the target device.
 * This method will also only instantiate a new HfpSession object if
 * one doesn't already exist for the associated BtDevice.
 * - Through HfpService::Connect().  This method is similar to
 * HfpService::GetSession() above, but also initiates an outbound
 * connection to the device.
 * - As part of an inbound connection, HfpService will automatically
 * instantiate an HfpSession for the device if one does not already exist.
 *
 * HfpSession objects are reference-counted
 * @ref managed "Bluetooth managed objects," and are always destroyed
 * under circumstances:
 * - Client reference count drops to zero.  Put().
 * - The HfpSession is in the Disconnected state.  See IsConnected(),
 * IsConnecting().
 * - Auto-reconnect is not enabled.  See RfcommSession::SetAutoReconnect().
 * - As with all @ref managed "managed objects," the actual destruction
 * is performed in the context of a timer event.
 *
 * The HfpSession class is designed so that clients may interact with it
 * without defining derived classes.  All notifications provided by
 * HfpSession are performed through Callback callback objects.
 *
 * Clients may override the instantiation path for HfpSession objects by
 * registering their own factory method to HfpService::cb_HfpSessionFactory.
 * As part of a specialized factory, clients may use the default factory
 * method, HfpService::DefaultSessionFactory().  A specialized factory
 * may be used to:
 * - Register all relevant callbacks with the HfpSession object from a
 * single path, and before any may be invoked.
 * - Instantiate a class derived from HfpSession with additional
 * functionality.  This is recommended only as a last resort.
 *
 * @section hfpscallbacks Callbacks
 *
 * The HfpSession object provides numerous callbacks, and uses the
 * @ref callbacks "Bluetooth module rules for non-nesting."
 *
 * @section hfpsstate State
 *
 * The session may be in one of three states:
 * - Disconnected: ! IsConnecting() && ! IsConnected()
 * - Connecting: IsConnecting()
 * - Connected: IsConnected()
 *
 * When Disconnected or Connecting, none of the feature inquiries are
 * meaningful, no state indicator and call state notifications will
 * be delivered, the audio connection must be Disconnected, and no
 * commands may be issued on the device.
 *
 * Once connected, the device will accept commands, state indicator
 * notifications will be delivered and certain values retained, and the
 * voice audio channel may be connected.

	 * @brief Notification of an asynchronous change to the device
	 * connection state
	 *
	 * The connection state, from the perspective of HfpSession
	 * clients, has three states:
	 * - Disconnected: ! IsConnecting() && ! IsConnected()
	 * - Connecting: IsConnecting()
	 * - Connected: IsConnected()
	 *
	 * The audio gateway may transition from Disconnected to
	 * Connecting, from Connecting to Connected, and from either
	 * Connecting or Connected to Disconnected.  There is no legal
	 * transition directly from Disconnected to Connected.
	 *
	 * As a rule, @ref callbacks "no callbacks are invoked in a nested fashion from method calls."
	 * State changes effected directly by Connect() and Disconnect()
	 * are not reported through this mechanism, and clients must notice
	 * such state changes directly.  State changes caused by
	 * connections initiated by the audio gateway or the auto-reconnect
	 * mechanism, connections that have completed negotiation,
	 * and connection attempts that have failed for reasons other than
	 * Disconnect() are reported.
	 *
	 * For example, if a HfpSession object in the Disconnected state
	 * has its Connect() method invoked, it will transition to the
	 * Connecting state, but no notification will be generated through
	 * HfpSession::cb_NotifyConnection.  Later, after negotiation
	 * completes, and the object transitions to the Connected state,
	 * a notification WILL be generated because the event causing the
	 * transition was system-generated and while it may have been the
	 * result of an earlier call to Connect(), the notification is not
	 * being generated from directly underneath that call.
	 *
	 * The transition to the Connected state is always done from the
	 * Connecting state, and will always be notified through this
	 * callback.  Because most queries and commands cannot be made of
	 * the device until it enters the Connected state, it is critical
	 * that clients receive notification of it.
	 *
	 * @param HfpSession* The HfpSession object that has had an
	 * asynchronous state transition to its service-level connection.
	 * @param error Error information structure.  If the state
	 * transition was to the Disconnected state, the ErrorInfo*
